As I learn how to use Terraform, I pulled the Terraform templates from examples for my own purposes. There is an inherent risk involved with reusing code and it is something I can avoid as I learn how to write my own Terraform files. That being said, the templates did create VPCs and security groups however IAM users and roles should be created as well. 
I attempted to use the Terraform tutorial for Kubernetes to create and nginx server, but it still eludes me on how to resolve the error. If the server was provisioned, then the server should be secured with later configurations in Terraform or in the AWS management console directly. 
My current role places a high importance on logging so it was important to implement visibility into the environment using Elasticsearch. I would suggest that a next step would be to create some custom dashboards.
The reach goal of CI integrations was something that I was not familiar with but it is crucial to include automated code review before being pushed to deployment.
